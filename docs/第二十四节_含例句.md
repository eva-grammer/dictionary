**commando**  \[kə'mɑːndəʊ] n.  [英音](https://dict.youdao.com/dictvoice?audio=commando\&type=1)  [美音](https://dict.youdao.com/dictvoice?audio=commando\&type=2) 突击队， 突击队员 11824

**词源：** 1791, in a South African context, "private military raid undertaken by the Boers against the

natives for personal ends," also the name of the leader of the raid and the permission given for it,

from Afrikaans commando, "a troop under a commander," from Portuguese commando, literally

"party commanded" (see command (v.)).

英语单词 commando 来自南非荷兰语， 字面意思是“有指挥的一群人”。 这个单词原本指的

是南非布尔人的一种民兵组织。布尔人是住在南非的荷兰移民后裔与少量德国人、法国人通

婚后产生的白人民族，是南非的主要殖民者。 17 世纪时，荷兰人在南非建立殖民地之处，

为了对付当地土著，殖民当局颁发《 commando law》，强制要求所有殖民者在殖民地受到攻

击时都必须武装起来，至少配备一匹马和一把枪。这些武装民兵的基本单位就是 commando，

而这种做法则被称为 commandeer。 在 19 世纪，荷兰殖民者大量涌入南非，殖民地快速

扩张，与非洲土著人的冲突日益频繁。为了保障安全，已经获得自由的南非布尔人自愿恢复

commando 制度，组织起来，与非洲土著人展开武装斗争。在与人数超过己方的非洲土著人

的战斗中，布尔人组织的 commando 逐渐掌握了各种突击和游记战术。 英国殖民者自从 18

世纪末期登陆南非后，与已经扎根南非的布尔人之间展开了长达百年的争夺，先后爆发了两

次战争， 史称“布尔战争”（ 1880-1881 年、 1899-1902 年）。 在战争中， 布尔人利用自己的

commando 制度，与占人数优势的英国军队展开了游击战。分成小股的布尔人 commando

利用自己的机动性、枪法和对地形的了解，对英国军队屡屡展开偷袭并得手。英国军队最后

不得不依赖碉堡战术、焦土政策和残暴的集中营来对付布尔人。在两次布尔战争中，布尔人

的 commando 给英国人乃至全世界留下了深刻印象，该词也因而进入了英语。&#x20;
