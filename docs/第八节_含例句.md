**weird** \[wɪəd] [英音](https://dict.youdao.com/dictvoice?audio=weird\&type=1)  [美音](https://dict.youdao.com/dictvoice?audio=weird\&type=2)  adj. 怪异的；不可思议的；超自然的 3731

**词源：** c. 1400, "having power to control fate, from wierd (n.), from Old English wyrd "fate,

chance, fortune; destiny; the Fates," literally "that which comes," from Proto-Germanic \*wurthiz (source also of Old Saxon wurd, Old High German wurt "fate," Old Norse urðr "fate, one of the three Norns"), from PIE \*wert- "to turn, to wind," (source also of German werden, Old English weorðan "to become"), from root \*wer- (2) "to turn, bend." For sense development from "turning" to "becoming," compare phrase turn into "become."

The sense "uncanny, supernatural" developed from Middle English use of weird sisters for the

three fates or Norns (in Germanic mythology), the goddesses who controlled human destiny. They

were portrayed as odd or frightening in appearance, as in "Macbeth" (and especially in 18th and

19th century productions of it), which led to the adjectival meaning "odd-looking, uncanny"

(1815); "odd, strange, disturbingly different" (1820). Related: Weirdly; weirdness.

**词源：** late 14c., "roll of parchment containing writing; a bound book," from Old French volume

"scroll, book; work, volume; girth, size" (13c.) and directly from Latin volumen (genitive

voluminis) "roll (of a manuscript); coil, wreath," literally "that which is rolled," from volvere "to

turn around, roll," from PIE root \*wel- (3) "to turn, revolve." Meaning "book forming part of a

set" is 1520s in English, from that sense in French. Generalized sense of "bulk, mass, quantity"

(1620s) developed from that of "bulk or size of a book" (1520s), again following the sense

evolution in the French word.
