**fetish**  \['fetɪʃ] n.  [英音](https://dict.youdao.com/dictvoice?audio=fetish\&type=1)  [美音](https://dict.youdao.com/dictvoice?audio=fetish\&type=2) 迷信； 偶像； 恋物（ 等于 fetich） 16609

**词源：** "material object regarded with awe as having mysterious powers or being the representative

of a deity that may be worshipped through it," 1610s, fatisso, from Portuguese feitiço "charm,

sorcery, allurement," noun use of an adjective meaning "artificial."

在西非和中非的一些原始部落流行传统的实物崇拜，这是一种非常原始的宗教。这些原始部

落由于对自然现象缺乏理解，以为许多物体如石块、木片、树枝、弓箭等具有灵性，并赋以

神秘的、超自然的性质，以及支配人的命运的力量。他们将这种灵性物品制作成护身符，或

当成偶像来进行崇拜。 最初来到西非的葡萄牙航海家、水手和商人接触这些非洲原始部落

后， 将他们所崇拜的这些护身符或偶像称为 feitiço， 意思是“人造的”， 来自拉丁语 facticius

（人造的）。 1760 年，著名人类学家查尔斯·德·布霍斯（ Charles De Brosses）在其著作中

提到了非洲原始部落的这种实物崇拜，并在葡萄牙语 feitiço 的基础上构造了法语 fétiche，

英语单词 fetish 正是来源于此。 在宗教领域， fetish 表示“实物崇拜， 拜物”； 在心理学领域，

fetish 表示“恋物”。

**释义：**

1\)（ N-COUNT） 迷恋 ； 痴迷 If you say that someone has a fetish for doing something, you

disapprove of the fact that they do it very often or enjoy it very much.
